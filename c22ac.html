                Wildfires pose a persistent challenge for policymakers, inflicting millions of dollars in damages to
                homes, forests, and sometimes even claiming lives annually. In recent decades, prescribed burning has
                emerged as a key strategy to mitigate wildfire risks. This method involves controlled burns in targeted
                areas to clear out flammable materials, thereby reducing fuel availability for large wildfires. These
                small fires can be extinguished easily if they become hostile. While prescribed burning has proven
                effective in wildfire prevention, concerns have arisen regarding its efficacy amidst the increasing
                frequency of high-intensity wildfires, likely influenced by climate change. Consequently, the primary
                objective of this research is to assess the effectiveness of prescribed burning under changing different
                factors. Furthermore, while prescribed burning serves to protect communities, it also raises
                environmental concerns including bad air quality, increased carbon emission, and erosion. Thus, the
                second objective is to explore the relationship between prescribed burning and the listed concerns.
                Additionally, public concerns have been raised about the potential negative impact of frequent burning
                on biodiversity. Therefore, the final objective of this study is to investigate the impact of prescribed
                burning on vegetation and animal populations. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to propose
                solutions for the development of effective fire control policies that prioritize both community and
                environmental sustainability.

                Frequent prescribed burning has raised concerns about potentially contaminating the air quality in local
                neighborhoods. The 2003 Lion Fire case study in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains provides insights
                into this issue. This fire covered over 33,000 acres and produced substantial smoke emissions that were
                carried long distances by wind patterns to the San Joaquin Valley and surrounding foothill communities
                in central California. The authors state that "the smoke was injected into a region that included
                several densely populated cities" (Schweizer and Cisneros 2014, p. 268). This contaminated the air
                breathed by millions of residents. However, the authors' detailed measurements and analysis showed that
                while smoke was present, the concentration of harmful particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air remained
                below the National Ambient Air Quality Standard set by the EPA, which is considered safe for public
                health.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-3 text-white-500 dark:text-white-400 mt-6">
                Specifically, they report that "maximum 24-hour PM2.5 levels remained below 65 μg/m3 [...] well below
                the federal standard of 35 μg/m3" (p. 274). Despite these reassuring results showing pollution levels
                within acceptable thresholds, the authors recommend fire managers take extra precautions for sensitive
                groups like the elderly, children, and those with respiratory issues who may experience impacts at lower
                PM2.5 levels. Their advice includes conducting prescribed burns only on low wind speed days and during
                humid conditions to minimize smoke drift into populated areas that could affect these vulnerable groups.
                Additionally, they suggest burning techniques like multi-day ignitions to reduce extreme spikes in PM2.5
                levels. With such proactive planning and mitigation tactics, the authors conclude that prescribed
                burning operations like the Lion Fire "can be conducted with minimal air quality impacts" (p. 277) while
                allowing the important ecological benefits of prescribed fire. Their multi-year data provides evidence
                that frequent burning need not contaminate neighborhood air quality when properly managed.

                Increasing burning frequency also raised public concern about releasing a harming amount of carbon in
                the atmosphere, which worsen the affect of climate change. However, a research showed the opposite of
                this concern. Prescribed burning is an increasingly utilized approach for reducing overall forest carbon
                emissions to the atmosphere. While it is true that prescribed fires do release carbon monoxide, carbon
                dioxide, and other greenhouse gases during the controlled combustion process, the research provides
                strong evidence that the emissions are significantly less than those from uncontrolled, high-severity
                wildfires. As stated in the study by Wiedinmyer and Hurteau, "The carbon emissions from prescribed
                burning were three to six times lower per unit area burned than wildfires" (p. 1930). Their modeling
                analyzed the effects across several forest types and found prescribed fire yielded these emission
                reduction benefits consistently across ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, and mixed conifer forests in the
                western United States.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-3 text-white-500 dark:text-white-400 mt-6">
                However, the researchers emphasized that a variety of influence factors can impact the degree of
                emission reductions, such as frequency and spatial distribution of the prescribed burn areas, the
                specific forest type and structure, and the amount of available fuel loads. Their data indicated the
                emission reduction benefits were greatest in forests with higher fuel loads compared to lower-load
                forests. Additionally, they found that increasing prescribed burn frequencies up to a certain point can
                substantially lower emissions over time as fuel loads are kept lower. As the authors summarize,
                "Widespread reintroduction of prescribed burning in fire-adapted forests of the western United States
                has the potential to substantially reduce wildfire emissions and their detrimental impacts on air
                quality" (p. 1931). By proactively managing forests with the strategic use of controlled prescribed
                burning, Wiedinmyer and Hurteau's research provides quantitative evidence that this approach can be an
                effective tool for lowering overall carbon emissions relative to the more catastrophic emission levels
                produced by severe wildfires.

                Burning destroyed the vegetation and habitats of various species. Many people worried that prescribed
                burning would kill animals and greatly reduced the biodiversity. Nonetheless, according to "Prescribed
                Burning vs. Wildfire Impacts on Plants, Lizards, and Mammals" by Pastro, he indicated that this method
                have positive impacts on plant populations compared to wildfires. Prescribed burning removes weeds,
                parasitic plants, and understory growth while leaving larger overstory plants relatively unharmed. This
                lowers competition for resources like light, water, and nutrients, promoting the overall environmental
                health of the ecosystem. Prescribed fires also give an advantage to fire-adapted, pyrophytic plant
                species that are better able to survive and regenerate after low-intensity burns. This increases local
                biodiversity while reducing fuel loads that could feed high-intensity wildfires (Pastro et al. 2011). In
                contrast, uncontrolled wildfires are often highly destructive to vegetation across all strata. While
                fast-growing weeds and invasive species can recover quickly post-fire, the taller overstory plants take
                much longer to re-establish, allowing weedy species to outcompete them and hinder forest regeneration.
                Thus, wildfires tend to decrease biodiversity compared to prescribed burning practices.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-3 text-white-500 dark:text-white-400 mt-6">
                Furthermore, more positive impacts were observed on animal populations compared to wildfire effects. The
                lower intensity and controlled application of prescribed fire allows mobile animals like mammals and
                birds to safely flee the burn area to unburned refuges nearby (Pastro et al. 2011). It also provides a
                rejuvenating ecological disturbance that can benefit certain taxa. For example, prescribed burning has
                been shown to increase abundances of invertebrates like insects and arachnids in the years post-burn,
                which attracts and increases populations of insectivorous species like lizards and small mammals that
                rely on these food sources (Valkó et al. 2016). Larger mammals are typically not impacted as they can
                easily escape localized prescribed fire fronts.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-3 text-white-500 dark:text-white-400 mt-6">
                In contrast, the rapid speed and high-intensity heat of wildfires can be devastating for animal
                populations. Fire intensities often prevent buffering species loss by leaving few unburned refuges
                nearby for wildlife to escape. The geographic extent and severity of wildfires mean they are much more
                likely to cause direct mortality to less mobile species (Pastro et al. 2011). This combined with the
                long-term habitat destruction results in major losses of biodiversity across plant and animal
                communities after wildfires compared to prescribed burns.

                While prescribed burning provided multiple benefit, it also had some negative impacts on the
                evironments. Fire managers should take into consideration the risk of soil erosion when initiating
                prescribed burning operations. The study by Morris et al. (2014) highlights this issue, finding that
                sediment yield increased by up to 700% and runoff increased by up to 200% in the first year after
                prescribed burning in the Mount Lofty Ranges of Australia. This occurs because as the vegetation and
                ground cover is burned off and plant roots die, the soil loses the stabilizing ability of those root
                systems to hold it in place against the erosive forces of water penetration and flooding events. Without
                this protection, the recently burned areas are highly susceptible to excessive erosion and soil loss
                until new vegetation can become re-established. The researchers emphasize the importance of conducting
                soil testing and developing erosion mitigation plans as part of the prescribed burn management process.
                This could include strategies like installing erosion barriers, avoiding burning on steep slopes,
                maintaining unburned patches, and timing burns based on predicted rainfall to reduce the erosion risk
                window. While prescribed burning provides ecological benefits, Morris et al. clearly demonstrate fire
                managers must carefully evaluate and plan for potential soil erosion impacts as well.

                Under the effect of modern climate changes, it is harder to conduct this operation. One of the primary
                challenges facing prescribed burning is the narrowing window of opportunity for conducting these
                controlled burns safely and effectively. With rising temperatures and increasingly arid landscapes, the
                conditions suitable for prescribed burning are becoming more elusive. The 2019-2020 Australian bushfires
                serve as a sobering testament to this reality. Despite extensive prescribed burning efforts, these fires
                raged with unprecedented ferocity, fueled by weather conditions that were remarkably hotter and drier
                than in previous years. Experimental simulations conducted by researchers like Hamish Clark and his team
                have corroborated these findings, predicting that as average temperatures continue to climb, more
                extreme fire weather events will become commonplace, significantly diminishing the effectiveness of
                prescribed burning as a standalone strategy.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-3 text-white-500 dark:text-white-400 mt-6">
                Compounding this challenge is the impact of rising greenhouse gas emissions on the available burning
                window. Climate models project that under high-emissions scenarios, the average number of days suitable
                for prescribed burning could plummet by 20-30% by the mid-21st century across vast swaths of the United
                States, including the Appalachian Mountains, where declines of 40% or more are anticipated. These
                projections are rooted in the reality that increased greenhouse gas concentrations amplify the frequency
                and severity of extreme conditions, such as soaring temperatures, low humidity, and diminished
                precipitation – factors that collectively curtail the viability of prescribed burning operations.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-3 text-white-500 dark:text-white-400 mt-6">
                In regions already grappling with the consequences of climate change, the prognosis is even more
                concerning. Simulations conducted under the RCP 8.5 scenario, which envisions a world characterized by
                high greenhouse gas concentrations and an average temperature increase of 3.7°C by the end of the 21st
                century, paint a dire picture for Mediterranean landscapes. These areas are projected to become
                increasingly hot, dry, and fire-prone, effectively shrinking the burning window to a mere sliver of the
                year when conditions are suitable for prescribed fires.

                Faced with these mounting challenges, researchers and fire managers are advocating for a multifaceted
                approach that integrates prescribed burning with complementary strategies. Forest thinning, a practice
                that involves selectively removing trees and vegetation to reduce fuel loads, is increasingly being
                viewed as a crucial component of a comprehensive fire management plan. By reducing the density of
                combustible materials, forest thinning can enhance the effectiveness of prescribed burning while
                mitigating the risk of high-severity wildfires. Additionally, researchers emphasize the importance of
                community-level fire prevention efforts, such as creating defensible spaces around homes and
                implementing stringent building codes to fortify structures against ember attacks.

            <p class="mb-3 text-white-500 dark:text-white-400 mt-6">
                Ultimately, prescribed burning is a effective method in managing wildfire, carbon emission, and
                faciliating biodiversity. However, as the challenges posed by climate change and environmental concerns
                continue to mount, it is clear that a one-size-fits-all approach to fire management is no longer
                tenable. Fire managers and policy makers, must integrate strategy that accounts for the unique
                characteristics of each landscape and the specific risks and vulnerabilities it faces.
